## Library 4

2D native barcoded library. Basecalled on Metrichor but not demultiplexed. Also basecalled and demultiplexed on Albacore. There were  raw reads, of which XX were basecalled, or XX% basecalled.

### Read counts after Albacore basecalling

* `barcode12`: 21
* `unclassified`: 43088

This is 5369 classified out of 48457 total or 11% classified.

## Library 5

2D native barcoded library. Basecalled on Metrichor but not demultiplexed. Also basecalled and demultiplexed on Albacore. There were 758796 raw reads, of which 1495306 were basecalled. _This looks suspiciously like the raw reads were basecalled twice, and all wrote to the same basecalled reads directory. We need to look into this in the pipeline and see what happened._

This is 10374 classified out of 1495306 total or 0.7% classified.

## Library 6

2D native barcoded library. Basecalled on Metrichor but not demultiplexed. Also basecalled and demultiplexed on Albacore.

### Read counts after Albacore basecalling

This is 2067 classified out of 511488 total or 0.4% classified.

## Library 7

1D native barcoded library. Barcode kit provided by ONT was missing barcode 10. Both pools of negative control are barcoded by barcode06. No barcode10 was prepared (any reads classified as barcode10 are wrongly assigned).
