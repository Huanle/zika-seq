        - `pass` - contains `.fast5` files
      - `basecalled_reads` - basecalled with Metrichor
        - `pass_demultiplex` - demultiplexed basecalled reads
          - `NB01` - contains `.fast5` files for NB01 barcode
          - `NB02` - contains `.fast5` files for NB02 barcode
          - etc...
        - `nonNB_demultiplexed` - demultiplexed basecalled reads
          - `BC01` - contains `.fast5` files for BC01 barcode
          - `BC02` - contains `.fast5` files for BC02 barcode
          - etc...
