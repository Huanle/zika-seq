# Consensus genomes

Genomes are collected into FASTAS with "good" coverage (>80%) and with "partial" coverage (50%-80%). FASTA headers obey the following format:

strain      | sample_id | collection_date | country | division    | location
----------- | --------- | --------------- | ------- | ----------- | --------
USVI/1/2016 | VI1       | 2016-09-28      | usvi    | saint_croix | saint_croix

## USVI samples

Isolates `USVI/1/2016` to `USVI/5/2016` in `ZIKA_USVI_good.fasta` and `ZIKA_USVI_partial.fasta`.
